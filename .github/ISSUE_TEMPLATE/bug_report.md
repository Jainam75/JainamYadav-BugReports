Software:

Name: Outlook Client
Version: 1.5
Bug Description:

The email client fails to send messages with attachments larger than 10MB.
Steps to Reproduce:

Open the Outlook.
Compose a new email.
Attach a file larger than 10MB.
Attempt to send the email.
Observe that the email fails to send and remains in the outbox.
Additional Information:

Device: Windows laptop
Operating System: Windows 10

Severity Label: Medium

Justification: While this bug affects the ability to send emails with large attachments, it does not completely prevent users from using the email client. However, it can be frustrating for users who frequently send large files via email. The impact is not as severe as a complete app crash or loss of data, hence a medium severity label is appropriate.
